# Welcome

Hi. This is my Clojure deps config that I use. It's tailored for my needs,
but I hope you find some things in here of use.

It lives under `$HOME/.clojure`.

Example usage:

`clj -M:base:local-dev:dev:test`

For more examples, with better explanations, I strongly suggest
studying [Practicalli's deps](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-deps-edn).

Feel free to choose what you like, reject what you don't like and I
hope you gain some benefit from this small repo.
